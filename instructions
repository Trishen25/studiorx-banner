The second is a bit more of a challenge.  I’m attaching a banner ad coded for a 300x600px ad placement.  I’d like you to leverage the code and resize it to 300x250.  To the best of your ability, resize this larger artwork (again, it doesn’t need to be perfect—you’d probably never be asked to do this without the correctly sized art).  I’m more interested in your reworking of the animation and placing elements in a visually appealing way inside the container rather than if an image is a bit cropped or smooshed.  The hint here is that this was a custom codebase developed at the agency—the only js file that will probably need to be adjusted is banner.js.
